                    <h2>Math</h2>
                    <p>I am of course extremely fond of mathematics! I think that no worldview is complete
                        without at least a passable understanding of mathematical reasoning. The origin of mathematics
                        and its effectiveness in the natural sciences is somewhat of a miracle- or at least, as a

                        I am currently teaching myself differential geometry/tensor calculus, which has been my holy grail-of-sorts
                        since high school. My research includes dynamical structure functions (DSFs) and what equivalence classes of 
                        computational structures exist for a single input-output mapping (or equivalently, what structures can be learned 
                        uniquely from the input-output data), as well as opinion dynamics in stochastically time-varying social networks models.

                    <h2>Languages</h2>
                    <p>I am an enthusiastic amateur linguist- I am absolutely fascinated 
                        with the ways that people think and express it through language.
                        I have a particular itch for historical linguistics-don't ever get me 
                        started on this subject if you have somewhere to be. I speak Latin and 
                        Persian fluently, and French and German passably. My good friend Max Haddock
                        and I have created a podcast about historical linguistics which you can listen to
